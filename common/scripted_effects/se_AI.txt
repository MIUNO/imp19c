#### DIPLOMATIC REASONING
# Mark out rivals
# There are different types of rivals depending on the balance of power
# The greater a country's power rating, the more rivals it can have

# RIVAL TYPES:
# Oppose - country should confront this rival head-on as a fight between equals
# Fear - country should seek the help of stronger nations against this rival 
# Domineer - Country should subsume this rival into their empire or sphere of influence
# Subvert - Country should knock down this rival's power

	# Notes:
	# AI countries without interests as defined here will pick activities based on a much simpler decision tree based
	# e.g. "control pops of my culture and religion", or "control claims"
	# Local powers will also react to plays in their TZ differently, acting more protectively.
