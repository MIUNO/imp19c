#### WAR

#### DIPLOMATIC REASONING
# Mark out rivals
# There are different types of rivals depending on the balance of power
# The greater a country's power rating, the more rivals it can have

# RIVAL TYPES:
# Oppose - country should confront this rival head-on as a fight between equals
# Fear - country should seek the help of stronger nations against this rival 
# Domineer - Country should subsume this rival into their empire or sphere of influence
# Subvert - Country should knock down this rival's power

#### DIPLOMATIC INTEREST
# Mark areas as "interests" to control

	# Function: Pick an area to mark as an interest and add it to the list in country scope
	# AI interests are areas that the AI will focus on accessing diplomatically
	# Methods of control include controlling the land directly or through a subject
	# TODO: Have a controller script that limits the number of interests based on the power rating of a country
