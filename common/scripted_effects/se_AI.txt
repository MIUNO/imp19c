# Mark out rivals
# There are different types of rivals depending on the balance of power
# The greater a country's power rating, the more rivals it can have

# RIVAL TYPES:
# Oppose - country should confront this rival head-on as a fight between equals
# Fear - country should seek the help of stronger nations against this rival 
# Domineer - Country should subsume this rival into their empire or sphere of influence
# Subvert - Country should knock down this rival's power

	# Diplomatic parity determines how much pressure root can put on target

	# Some actions "cost" less pressure to do and will therefore be more attractive to countries that are more on-par, or where root is less powerful than target
